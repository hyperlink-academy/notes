Hi, welcome!

We made this site to collect weeknotes, research, and ephemera — things
we generate as we build Hyperlink and explore learning futures.

Our first year, we made a little
[library](https://year-one.hyperlink.academy/library). The next year, we wove a
wiki in [hyperspace](https://space.hyperlink.academy/299766632440398340). This
year, a lab notebook.

Among other things, we're trying
[weeknotes](https://interconnected.org/home/2018/07/24/weeknotes), writing the
kind of thing we enjoy reading. We write primarily for ourselves, but hope you
find something interesting here too.

Things we're thinking about: attention, intention, boundaries, play,
visuals and vibes, rooms and READMEs, co-presence and conversation,
presence and aliveness, sessions, sprints, cycles, cadences…

Last year was exploratory: research, evolution, new foundations. Now,
we're finding focus in what we're making, playing with new ways of
working, having fun with process.
