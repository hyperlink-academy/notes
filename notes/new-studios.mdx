We've made some big changes to Studios, which we first launched a few months back, described in our earlier post, [Building Studios](https://notes.hyperlink.academy/note/building-studios).

Studios are a place for groups to organize activity happening across many Spaces — a homepage for a collection of projects or sessions.

Much of the "why" we initially wrote still holds, but the "what" is becoming more clear, though still a work in progress :)

Many of these changes / additions were inspired by exploring a use case around "internet gatherings" — people doing things together online, not exactly live events, but in a shared environment with shared intention. A big theme here is a much stronger focus on Spaces & people!

## Here's what's new

### Space list

**What**: add Spaces to a Studio, and view a gallery of all Spaces, with their creators listed, and presence indicators to give a sense of activity across the Studio

**Why**: we wanted to put the primary focus on exploring each other's projects, and make the whole page feel like a nice gallery — useful not only during a gathering or cohort, but before and after!

### About page

**What**: a place for the Studio creator to add a description / readme and header image

**Why**: to provide more context for what a Studio's all about — useful as both a welcome message for participants, and for visitors browsing

### Member list

**What**: member cards for everyone who joins the Studio, with a place for a Studio-specific bio + list of their Space(s); Studio creators can invite people with a custom welcome message people see when they join

**Why**: a better sense of the actual people participating, who may or may not know each other IRL (we want to keep improving this e.g. adding profile pics!)

### Space viewer

**What**: a way to browse Spaces in the context of the Studio, via a sort of carousel from the Space headers so you don't have to click back to the main Space list each time to get to the next Space

**Why**: encourage quickly browsing through Spaces to explore and see what's new

### Studiomates + commenting

**What**: experimenting with permissions where people in a shared Studio can comment on things in each other's Spaces, but not edit them

**Why**: play with ways of engaging with each other's projects, without the pressure to directly collaborate (NB: we _removed_ a more convoluted workflow for sharing cards from inside a Space to a Studio-level bulletin board — we want to keep experimenting more with the communication layer of a Studio)

### Inside Spaces…

We improved the experience within Spaces in a few ways too:

- support for multiple images on cards
- pretty-rendered links on cards (nicer to collect a bunch of links!)
- new, more fun and colorful chat styling

None of these are specific to Studios, but they do give us more powerful ways to collect and share information, which in turn makes it nicer to browse others' Spaces!

## Studios as Internet Clubs

We're excited about Studios that feel like a shared workshop — places to work alongside others in a way that feels good; to get inspiration and feedback and shared energy.

Right now we're particularly interested in Studios powering a sort of **internet club** where people work on their own projects, posting updates on a regular cadence, with a short newsletter to periodically share what everyone's up to.

We've got some experiments cooking, a few things we think will be fun contexts for testing this idea further. We'd love to chat if you're looking for a new way to host an online club or asynchronous gathering. More soon!
