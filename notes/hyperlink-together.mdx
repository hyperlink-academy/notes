We've been doing projects…with friends!

For the past ~2 months, we've been doing lots of experiments, talking with many of you, and working to make Hyperlink a great place to do small-scale collaborative projects.

We've been calling this focus area "Projects with Friends":

- **_projects_** — because concrete, creative goals help ground learning experiences in active exploration
- **_with friends_** — because these experiences are not only more fun but more meaningful when we do things together

This kind of creative collaboration — self-driven, exploratory, creative — is powerful, but hard to do well on the internet. Getting this right combines several things we're excited about: making online social experiences more human-scale; making project management feel more fun and organic; making it easy to riff and explore together.

We wrote more about our goals in our [previous post](https://notes.hyperlink.academy/note/projects-with-friends).

It was fun to have this more focused area to explore — and we've got a lot to show you!

When we started, we mentioned that notifications felt like one of the most pressing needs. This actually ended up as just one part of what we've come to see as a larger system…

# Hyperlink Together

Let's call this system **Hyperlink Together** — all about doing work in concert with close collaborators; convening and communicating in a shared Space.

Here are its key parts, and how they work together:

## Beacon, aka push notifications

We've taken advantage of recent improvements with progressive web apps, in particular their recent support on iOS, to enable push notifications for activity in Spaces.

This makes a Space function more like a group chat — rather than having to remember to check back, you can see as soon as your collaborators add something that needs your attention.

<CTA>

### How to Try

Add the app on mobile — from the share or three dot menu in your
browser, "Add to Home Screen". Then tap the settings icon on your Hyperlink
homepage, enable notifications, and you'll see new cards and comments in your
Spaces.

</CTA>

How it's useful:

- Patterns for how we use Spaces include making a 'general' chatroom, and commenting on cards to talk about particular tasks or essay drafts, both cases where we want to know when someone replies!
- In both our Spaces and others, we've seen it's common to start with a burst of energy but rapidly taper off; we think notifications can be a much stronger pull to continuously revisit a Space

<Sidebar>

### EXAMPLE: [Inktop](https://hyperlink.academy/s/charles/s/5/inktop)

started to chat about visions for designing new e-ink computers, discussing various concepts and aspects of hardware, where it would be useful to have an ongoing group chat for jamming on ideas

</Sidebar>

<Sidebar>

### EXAMPLE: [Frames with Celine and Kelsey](https://hyperlink.academy/s/celine/s/7/frames-with-celine-and-kelsey)

in this project, Celine wanted to share progress updates with her friend, but previously had to text her separately each every time; notifications make it easy to share updates alongside the full context of the project

</Sidebar>

## Here, aka realtime presence

With multiplayer presence, you can see everyone currently in a Space, and exactly where in the Space they are.

This sort of granular visibility helps you see what people are doing, which is nice for both gathering a general sense of shared energy in a Space, and focusing on doing particular things together.

<CTA>

### How to Try

You'll see this automatically when you're in a Space with others
at the same time. Each member will have a different color, and you'll be able
to see which rooms and cards they're in. We suggest planning a session to work
together for an hour or two — you can even do an audio call directly in the
Space, see below!

</CTA>

How it's useful:

- Convening a group on the internet in a way that feels like you're actually sharing space together is a great feeling!
- It's really nice to have this sense of togetherness, while also being able to do your own thing individually — and go between the two by easily seeing where others are, like a map, with both a freeform spatial element, and easy navigation

<Sidebar>

### EXAMPLE: [Hyperlink Writing Room 2023](https://hyperlink.academy/s/brendan/s/23/hyperlink-writing-room-2023)

with our own "writing room" Space, we often found it easier to work in sessions, exploring ideas in realtime and taking notes together, then asynchronously writing drafts and sharing feedback — live presence makes it easier to jump between ideas as we talk about them together

</Sidebar>

## Talk, aka audio calls

If multiple people are in a Space together, you can join an audio call and seamlessly start chatting. If you recall our "hyperspace" experiments from over a year ago, we're bringing this aspect back!

It's voice only, so that you can focus on the actual things you're exploring together — looking at cards, writing, reviewing, commenting — as you chat.

<CTA>
  
### How to Try
  
  Once you're in a Space together, start or join a call from the
  sidebar. You can switch audio devices and mute yourself if needed. You'll see
  from the member list who else is in the call with you — and with realtime
  presence, you can even see where in the Space they are.

</CTA>

How it's useful:

- When we do phone calls, we form an intimate tunnel to one another, but we don't inhabit the same space; with video calls we can do the 'share screen' dance, but it's a different dynamic, more like a presentation
- In Hyperlink the Space is first, a shared place with the call layered on top; we can talk together but focus our attention on the actual things we're exploring — and go back and forth between looking at the same things together, and each doing our own work in each other's presence

<Sidebar>

### EXAMPLE: [Mold Net](https://hyperlink.academy/s/yet/s/4/mold-net)

We joined our friends Jake and JT for a video call when they started a Space for "Mold Net", an experimental mycelial search engine, before we had calls built in — it was cool to peek in at a collaborative session, but we wished it were a more unified experience!

### EXAMPLE: [Cycle: Projects with Friends](https://hyperlink.academy/s/jared/s/9/cycle-projects-with-friends)

In our shared team Space for our current cycle, we're finding it useful to be able to chat together on daily standup calls, and share notes both during the call and right after as we get into our respective work for the day

</Sidebar>

## All Together Now…

The combination of these things — Beacon (notifications), Talk (audio calls), and Here (live presence) — help us not only work together in the moment, but also see things each other did when we check back later.

We can jam on something live, but also review new cards and reply to messages on our own time. Being able to blend sync and async interactions is a big part of the magic here — a social system for working together over time.

In our own work, this spans different rhythms, from day to day product work where we may do a quick check-in to start the day and then each work on different tasks, to essay writing where we have a variety of ideas taking shape over weeks and months, touching base every so often with writing sessions but also individually working on drafts.

From what we've observed, many shared projects benefit from this mix of realtime sessions for doing focused work together, and a place for projects to persist and evolve over longer periods.

## Other improvements

- **better navigation**: simplified the homepage Space list and Space creation flow (removed the need to pick dates in favor of archiving)
- **better onboarding**: improved experience when you first join Hyperlink, including new docs and a README card when you create a new Space
- **unreads room**: an inbox where you can easily see all unreads cards and conversations in a Space
- **backlinks**: improved across the app to support not only linked cards but inline wiki-links and cards in chats / rooms

## Let's do some projects

We'd love for you to give the app a try…or another try, if you played around a while back — it's now much more useful for doing things with other people.

- [Sign up for Hyperlink here!](https://hyperlink.academy/)
- Add the app and enable notifications ([app details](https://hyperlink.academy/docs?tab=app))
- Explore a few example Spaces ([view examples](https://hyperlink.academy/docs?tab=examples))
- Make a Space and invite a friend!

If you give Hyperlink a try, we'd love to know — what's your top request to make this great for your collaborative projects? [Email us anytime](mailto:contact@hyperlink.academy) :)

### Print a Poster

That image at the top is a 8.5" x 11" poster!

Print it at home; post it to a bulletin board in a local space where you like to work, or
a telephone pole on your block. You can also send it directly to a
friend…along with an invite link to join a Space, if you like!

</Sidebar>

Two other things that may help you get started:

- **Personal Onboarding** — join us for a 1:1 call to chat about your projects, give the app a test drive, and set up your first Space!
  - BUTTON: [Schedule 1:1 Onboarding](https://calendly.com/jared-hyperlink)
- **Hyperlink Office Hours** — join a community hang to talk internet collaboration & explore project ideas together
  - BUTTON: [RSVP for Office Hours!](https://partiful.com/e/KYBnXghQkOx67zuxQdlJ)

## What's next?

We're excited for our next round of experiments — likely around events, sessions, scheduling, time, bringing people together to do cool things.

First, we're taking a bit of time between cycles, to do a burst of onboarding (see above!) and continue making the app better for your projects.

In a few weeks, we'll announce our next cycle. Stay tuned!
