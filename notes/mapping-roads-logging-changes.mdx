We revamped our docs / help center, available both in-app (via the **?** icon) and [on its own special page here](https://hyperlink.academy/docs/).

Three things to check out:

- **Handbook**: rewrote our quick guide to various parts of the app
- **Roadmap**: what we're working on, now and soon!
- **Changelog**: this was the biggest lift, tracking important additions / changes going back two years (95 entries; nearly 6k words)

The Roadmap and Changelog work together nicely to keep tabs on things we ship, things we later un-ship or change in major ways, the biggest things next on our list, and how everything fits together.

Quick highlights of recent changes include:

- Multiple images on cards (popular request!)
- Pretty link previews for external URLs on cards
- Improved chat styling for more clear and colorful conversations
- Card background colors
- Deeplinking to cards, to copy and share anywhere

The Roadmap includes a lot of common requests and things we've wanted to build for a while, like a block-based card editor, multi-column card viewer, resizable canvas, and private Spaces.

It also includes some high level use cases we're excited to support — right now, creative peer-driven internet clubs; in the near future, a new generation of independent schools.

What do you think…useful? Fun to read? What would _you_ put as #1 next thing on the roadmap?
