## Email Digests for Internet Clubs

This past month we've been running [a few internet clubs](https://notes.hyperlink.academy/note/internet-clubs) — a few dozen people making websites, reading books on learning and parenting, and sharing daily creative crafts.

As part of this, a key thing we've been testing is a communication loop outside the Hyperlink app itself, via simple weekly email digests.

This kind of pop-up newsletter is a place for us to summarize activity, reflect on how things are going, solicit feedback, and generally keep participants in the loop — extra important with longer async clubs.

## The Club-Newsletter Loop

We think this dynamic — a feedback loop of both regular creative activity among a group, and regular emails to share it — could be a particularly nice fit for existing newsletters and their communities!

For newsletters where collaborative creative activity is a natural fit, this can be a way to bootstrap more active participation from community members _and_ generate interesting activity that feeds back into the writing pipeline.

Newsletters, even small ones, have a couple great things going:

- a regular cadence of publishing activity
- focus on a particular niche or theme

Which together often mean a strong baseline level of interest from readers in further exploring the terrain the newsletter's already actively mapping. For example:

- If I'm subscribed to Craig's [Roden or Ridgeline](https://craigmod.com/newsletters/) or Alex's [Pedestrian](https://pedestrian.substack.com/), I probably like photography and going on long walks
- If I'm subscribed to Laurel's [Another Day in the Dome](https://anotherdayinthedome.substack.com/) or Kristoffer's [Naive Weekly](https://www.naiveweekly.com/), it's a good bet I'm into indie websites and internet art
- If I'm subscribed to Abena's [Your Friend in Food](https://yourfriendinfood.substack.com/), you know I like cooking and dinner parties

## How the Loop Might Loop

Imagine you write a newsletter on a niche topic, let's say pottery, let's say called "Thoughts on Pots", an ascendant voice in the handcraft scene.

There's a feedback loop we can imagine that looks something like this:

- Once you have a decent number of folks following along (maybe 50–100), you propose an activity, like "Thoughts on Pots Wheel Week", where people can share their wheel-thrown work
- You set up a Studio on Hyperlink as a simple group homepage, and invite everyone to join and share their current projects
- For the next week: a handful of other potter-thoughters post photos, ideas for future projects, notes of encouragement, etc.
- Once it wraps up, you write about it — how the experiment went, what work emerged, new directions the group finds interesting (gestural handbuilding? glaze alchemy?)
- You can repeat on whatever cadence you like, try new variants next time, and even encourage participants to try facilitating future things

The part that makes it a loop is the output of a group's activity feeding into meaningful writing, and sparking new things to try together, all filtered through the actual interests and participation of your community.

It feels like this could get a nice pulse going — particularly with a wider community of practice (i.e. all subscribers) as background for the more intimate group doing a given activity. Even folks who can't take part might enjoy spectating, offer feedback, and get excited to join next time.

## Join the Party

We're partly going off a hunch, but there are all sorts of examples where people are doing interesting communal experiments and group activity with newsletters as just one piece of the puzzle.

- Craig Mod runs [walk and talks](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/176/) that sound amazing
- Daniel of Maximum New York not only writes prolifically but runs [a whole slate of courses on local civics](https://www.maximumnewyork.com/p/school)
- Anne from Notes From a Small Press also runs [publishing workshops](https://thinkingwriter.org/about/)
- Naive Weekly now hosts a conference, [Naive Yearly](https://naiveyearly.com/), celebrating the poetic handmade internet
- Kate Ray writes about recipes and hosts [cooking classes and experimental dinner parties and more](https://kateray.net/work-with-me)
- Rob Walker's [Art of Noticing](https://robwalker.substack.com/about) is all about perceptive and participatory exercises, both solo and social
- [Jess Martin](https://jessmart.in/) writes and organizes events on the future of computing and tools for thought
- [The Big Read](https://thebigread.substack.com/) runs newsletters-as-book-clubs
- Victoria [loves paper](https://vrklovespaper.substack.com/) and makes zines and tools for papercraft and hosts meetups for other paper-lovers

Many newsletter-adjacent social experiments happen offline, or have no need for fancy tools, and that's great!

But some, particularly ones with participants spread across the globe, sharing or working asynchronously, could use a nicer environment to do things together online. And that's a place where we think Hyperlink can offer something special.

If you write a newsletter and like the idea of this sort of experimental internet club, we encourage you to give it a try, and we'd love to help however we can.
